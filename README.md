## Overview

This repository contains a Python data analysis project that processes and analyzes e-commerce data from three datasets: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, and `order_details.csv`. The project performs data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization to derive insights such as total sales by region, top-selling product categories, and payment method statistics. The implementation is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (`python_data-analysis_project.ipynb`) using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Project Purpose

The project aims to:
- **Load and Merge Data**: Combine customer, order, and order details data into a unified DataFrame.
- **Clean Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize data, and ensure data integrity.
- **Analyze Data**: Calculate total sales by region, identify the top product category, and analyze orders by payment method.
- **Visualize Data**: Create a bar chart of total sales by region.
- **Save Results**: Export cleaned data and analysis results to CSV files.

## File Descriptions

- **`python_data-analysis_project.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. It implements all tasks outlined below.
- **`Total Sales by Region.png`**: A bar chart visualizing the total sales for each region, generated by the notebook.
- **`category_sales.xls`**: Contains the total sales for each product category.
- **`clean_customers.xls`**: The cleaned `customers.csv` dataset after removing duplicates and filling missing emails.
- **`clean_order_details.xls`**: The cleaned `order_details.csv` dataset after removing duplicates, negative values, and normalizing `product_category`.
- **`cleaned_ecommerce_data.xls`**: The merged and fully cleaned DataFrame containing all relevant columns from customers, orders, and order details.
- **`cleaned_orders.xls`**: The cleaned `orders.csv` dataset after removing duplicates and filling missing `total_amount` values.
- **`customers.xls`**: Raw input data containing customer information (`customer_id`, `email`, `region`).
- **`order_details.xls`**: Raw input data containing order item details (`order_id`, `product_id`, `product_category`, `quantity`, `unit_price`).
- **`orders.xls`**: Raw input data containing order details (`order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`, `payment_method`).
- **`payment_stats.xls`**: Contains the number of orders and average sales for each payment method.
- **`region_sales_summary.xls`**: Contains the total sales for each region.

**Note**: The files are saved as `.xls` (Excel) format, but the notebook likely reads and processes `.csv` files as inputs. Ensure the raw data files (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`) are in the repository or update the notebook to handle `.xls` inputs if necessary.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Load and Merge Data
- Load three CSV files: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, and `order_details.csv`.
- Merge data by `customer_id` and `order_id` using an inner join to retain complete records(rigon_sales_summary.xls).
- using `.info()` for checking data information.

### 2. Clean the Data
- Fill missing `email` values with `"unknown@email.com"`.
- Fill missing `total_amount` values with the sum of `quantity × unit_price` from `order_details` for the corresponding `order_id`.
- Normalize `product_category` to title case (e.g., "electronics" → "Electronics").
- Remove duplicate rows from all datasets and the merged DataFrame.
- Convert `order_date` to datetime format.
- Remove rows with negative `quantity` or `unit_price`.
- Output a summary of missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.

### 3. Analyze the Data
- Calculate total sales (sum of `total_amount`) for each region, saved as `region_sales_summary.xls`.
- Identify the product category with the highest sales, saved as `category_sales.xls`.
- Calculate the number of orders and average sales for each payment method, saved as `payment_stats.xls`.
- Display results using `print()` statements in the notebook.

### 4. Visualize the Data
- Create a bar chart of total sales by region using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Include title ("Total Sales by Region"), x-axis label ("Region"), and y-axis label ("Total Sales (USD)").
- Save the chart as `Total Sales by Region.png`.

### 5. Save Results
- Save the cleaned merged DataFrame as `cleaned_ecommerce_data.xls`.
- Save the region total sales analysis as `region_sales_summary.xls`.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JackYu-111/-1-python_data-analysis_project.git
   cd -1-python_data-analysis_project
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure Data Files**:
   Place the raw data files (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`) in the project directory. If the notebook expects `.xls` files, ensure they are available or update the code to read `.xls` using `pandas.read_excel`.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `python_data-analysis_project.ipynb` and execute the cells to perform the analysis.

2. **Expected Outputs**:
   - Cleaned datasets: `clean_customers.xls`, `clean_order_details.xls`, `cleaned_orders.xls`, `cleaned_ecommerce_data.xls`.
   - Analysis results: `region_sales_summary.xls`, `category_sales.xls`, `payment_stats.xls`.
   - Visualization: `Total Sales by Region.png`.
